Multiple Celebration Wedidng Invitation Site

Are you in the unenviable position of requiring more than one wedding ceremony or celebration?
Do you want a want to invite some people to only one celebration, but others to both?
Do you not want the invite to be personal, but not have to send out a physical invite?
Then this is for you!

This is a Play! application, written in Java, that stores invites in a backend database.  Everyone
gets their own invitation, and is able to RSVP to whichever ceremony or celebration you have invited
them to.

Create you own website in the 'invite.scala.html' page.  You can then managed your invitations by
heading to the admin page (https://yourhost/admin).

You will need to setup the database, email and dropbox backups, admin login passwords, and crypto
keys in the wedding.conf and application.conf files.
